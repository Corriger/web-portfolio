            <p>A straight templated version of the Devil Hunter site. I make these things for a, uh... roleplaying site. Just another way of getting my creative juices flowing where they need to. Also uses <span>jQuery</span>.</p>

            <p>The site that kickstarted me into the path of a web developer. First instance of using <span>Javascript</span> - specifically the <span>jQuery</span> framework - to create the tab function up in the top right of the page. This was pre-Bootcamp, so it is far from responsive and not the most reuseable in terms of layout. But it, on top of my willingness to teach others that didn't know as much as me, got me into Resilient Coders in the first place.</p>
            <p>An improved, refactored version is on its way.</p>
